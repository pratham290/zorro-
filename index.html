        <p> Hi my name is Pratham Shah and I just studying at Rmit university city campus this year, and my student id and email is s3943888 and s3943888@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in India, Rajkot in 2003 and my family quickly moved to Australia in 2007 as my parents wanted a better life style for my sister and I, who is only a year younger than me. Since I was born in the state of Gujarat my first language is Gujarati and second is English, and my nationality is Hinduism and my culture goes back to 1000 years and currently Gujarati is spoken by more than 60 million people world wide.  In my  culture we celebrate a festival know as Deepawali which is basically the festival of light where you light small candles all around your home and have bright lights everywhere which symbolises god coming into your life and all the darkness going away.  A few facts about me include my interest in physical activity like playing basketball, doing swimming and working out. I also workout at the gym and its been 2 years since I started at Anytime Fitness and Iâ€™ve been loving it, In my free time I like to play call of duty, nba and chess.</p>
