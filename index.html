        <h1> Personal Information: </h1>
        <p> Hi, my name is Pratham Shah and I am studying at Rmit university, city campus this year, and my student id and email is s3943888 and s3943888@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in India, Rajkot in 2003 and my family moved to Australia in 2007 as my parents wanted a better lifestyle for my sister and I, who is only a year younger than me. I was born in the state of Gujarat therefore my first language is Gujarati and my second language is English, my nationality is Hinduism and my culture goes back to 1000 years, and currently Gujarati is spoken by more than 60 million people world wide. In my culture we celebrate lots of festivals, a popular festival of India that is known all around the world is Deepawali which is basically the festival of light where you light small candles all around your home and have bright lights everywhere which symbolises god coming into your life and all the darkness going away.  A few facts about me include my interest in physical activity like playing basketball, swimming and working out. I also workout at the gym and it has been 2 years since I started at Anytime Fitness and I’ve been loving it, in my free time I like to play call of duty, nba and chess.<p> 
        
        <h1> Interest in I.T: </h1>
<p> My interest in i.t comes from the fact that I’m always going to be heavily surrounded by all types of technology as it is also continuously changing all around the world, and I won’t have to worry about there being any shortage of roles for this job as the world is technology reliant it wouldn’t be difficult to find a secure job. Another reason for my interest in Information Technology is that once I get a job in the I.T career I’ll be bound to meet all kinds of different people along the way who may have the same interests as me and working with them would help me stay attached to I.T.<p> 
 
<p> My interest in I.T first began when I was in year 10, due to choosing my own elective I had chosen I.T for the first time without having any prior knowledge or experience of the subject, turns out I really started to enjoy this subject and the concept of programming and creating websites using programs like visual studio basics, and pycharm. The only reason I had begun to enjoy I.T in the first place is because my teacher for the subject and I got along and he was incredible in the way he taught us; due to the teacher’s friendly nature and down to earth personality it made the class very enjoyable for everyone, and I ended up loving something I had just started to learn. Coincidentally for the next two years of school I had the same teacher and it really kept me hooked to the subject as I would always enter the classroom with excitement, and this is the person who sparked the interest of I.T me, and from then onwards I became very passionate about it.<p> 
 
<p> I decided to come to RMIT as my first preference over other universities, because I preferred a place where I could go for a great experience for the desired course and there was no place better than going to RMIT for Information Technology because RMIT has a 5-star ranking for excellence in higher education and 96% of graduates found a full-time job within one year of graduation, according to (Why Choose RMIT n.d.) furthermore there are amongst the “top 10 universities in Australia for studies in information technology” referencing to (University n.d.)  
At the end of my studies at Rmit university I expect to learn all the fundamentals of Information Technology and all the concepts with a great understanding that would help me in developing my skills in this field, which will result in me finding a job because of my knowledge acquired from Rmit. I also expect to learn all my subjects like intro to programming and intro to info tech to the best knowledge as I can with the help of my teachers. <p>

        <h1>  Ideal job: </h1>
        <p> An ideal job for me in the I.T field which interests me would be a senior cybersecurity analyst. A senior cybersecurity analyst is a person with many years of experience within the workforce who has acquired all the knowledge within the company to hold this senior position and being able to manage an entire company’s security system from cyber-attacks and anything that can harm the companies network systems from the outside. The senior analyst also must direct the employees in safeguarding the entire companies’ organisation from any potential breaches coming from anywhere and becoming the employee’s leader in these threatful situations. This position has intrigued me because this role requires a person to have enough potential to organise a company and creating a company’s security system to prevent breaches while managing it in their own unique ways. Another point that has grabbed my attention is its massive pay scale which ranges anywhere from 120-140 thousand dollars per annum.
