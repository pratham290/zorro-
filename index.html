        <h1> Personal Information </h1>
        <p> Hi, my name is Pratham Shah and I am studying at Rmit university, city campus this year, and my student id and email is s3943888 and s3943888@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in India, Rajkot in 2003 and my family moved to Australia in 2007 as my parents wanted a better lifestyle for my sister and I, who is only a year younger than me. I was born in the state of Gujarat therefore my first language is Gujarati and my second language is English, my nationality is Hinduism and my culture goes back to 1000 years, and currently Gujarati is spoken by more than 60 million people world wide. In my culture we celebrate lots of festivals, a popular festival of India that is known all around the world is Deepawali which is basically the festival of light where you light small candles all around your home and have bright lights everywhere which symbolises god coming into your life and all the darkness going away.  A few facts about me include my interest in physical activity like playing basketball, swimming and working out. I also workout at the gym and it has been 2 years since I started at Anytime Fitness and I’ve been loving it, in my free time I like to play call of duty, nba and chess.<p> 
        
        <h1> Interest in I.T: </h1>
        <p>An ideal job for me in the I.T field which interests me would be a senior cybersecurity analyst. A senior cybersecurity analyst is a person with many years of experience within the workforce who has acquired all the knowledge within the company to hold this senior position and being able to manage an entire company’s security system from cyber-attacks and anything that can harm the companies network systems from the outside. The senior analyst also must direct the employees in safeguarding the entire companies’ organisation from any potential breaches coming from anywhere and becoming the employee’s leader in these threatful situations. This position has intrigued me because this role requires a person to have enough potential to organise a company and creating a company’s security system to prevent breaches while managing it in their own unique ways. Another point that has grabbed my attention is its massive pay scale which ranges anywhere from 120-140 thousand dollars per annum. <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56317307?type=standout#sol=b57e4bf03949ae089acfa097fc8f1471d8615f07">My Job</a> <p>
